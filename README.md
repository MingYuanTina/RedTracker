Red Tracker is a fertility monitoring service for married women in Bangladesh wanting to get pregnant.  A woman will share the start date of her period with the service.  Using that start date, the service can let a woman know if she might be ovulating and when she should be expecting her next period.  If a period is missed both the woman and a community health worker will be informed.
